	<p>The required text for this course is: <br/>
	  <br/>
	  <span>
	    <em>
	      College Algebra: Concepts and Contexts
	    </em>
	  </span>,
	  <span class="math inline">1<sup>st</sup>
	  </span>
	  Edition, Stewart, Redlin, Watson, Panman, 2011. ISBN 9781424089208.
	</p>
	<p>The university bookstore offers two options for obtaining this text:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left:5em">
	  <li><p>A bundle that includes a hard copy of the text and a WebAssign access key,</p></li>
	  <li><p>A WebAssign access key that grants access to a digital copy of the text.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>You may choose either option, however, be aware that it is <span><strong>expected</strong></span> that you will read the text outside of lecture.</p>
	<h2 id="course-website" class="unnumbered">Course Website:</h2>
	<p>The URL for the course website is</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://people.math.sc.edu/farmanb/courses/111/F17/index.html" class="uri">http://people.math.sc.edu/farmanb/courses/111/F17/index.html</a></p>

	<h1 id="coursework" class="unnumbered">Coursework</h1>
	<h2 id="homework" class="unnumbered">Homework:</h2>
	<p>Homework assignments are available on WebAssign. All WebAssign homework assignments are currently available and may be accessed using the class key</p>
	<p style="text-align:center"><span><strong>sc 8392 8850</strong></span></p>
	<p>It is important that you create a WebAssign account and register for the course as soon as possible.</p>
	<p>The assignments are separated into three groups corresponding to the material on each of the exams. The problems are chosen to highlight the core concepts on each exam and mastery of these homework sets serve as a good indicator for exam performance. As such, you should ensure that you fully understand the material on these homework sets; that is, upon completion of the homework set, you should be capable of completing similar problems without the aid of the text or the various tools provided by WebAssign.</p>
	<p>The homework sets in each group are due the day before the corresponding exam. Late work will <span><strong>not</strong></span> be accepted, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that these assignments are completed on time. These assignments are relatively long, so you should be working through them as we cover the material. Do <span><strong>not</strong></span> leave these assignments until the last minute.</p>
	<h2 id="exams" class="unnumbered">Exams:</h2>
	<p>There will be three in-class exams. The exams are tentatively scheduled as follows:</p>
	<table>
	  <tbody>
	    <tr class="odd">
	      <td style="text-align:left">Exam 1:</td>
	      <td style="text-align:left">Thursday, September 28, 2017,</td>

	    </tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>Though unexpected, any deviations from this schedule will be announced during lecture and reflected on the course website.</p>
	<h3 id="missed-assessments" class="unnumbered">Missed Assessments:</h3>
	<p>There will <span><strong>not</strong></span> be any make-up exams or quizzes. If you miss one exam, your final exam grade will replace the missing exam grade. <strong>This policy is intended only for exams missed due to illness, accidents, etc. It does NOT mean that your lowest exam grade will be dropped.</strong> Any further missed exams will receive a grade of zero.</p>
	<h2 id="final-exam" class="unnumbered">Final Exam:</h2>
	<p>There will be a cumulative final exam on Tuesday, December 12, 2017 at 7:30 pm. The date and time of the final exam is determined by the registrar and <strong>may not be changed</strong> except under extreme circumstances. <strong>Scheduling your travel home before the day of the final exam does not constitute a valid excuse for rescheduling the final exam.</strong> Failure to appear at the final exam will result in a zero on the final exam.</p>

	<h1 id="student-success-center" class="unnumbered">Student Success Center</h1>
	<p>In partnership with UofSC faculty, the Student Success Center (SSC) offers a number of programs to assist you in better understanding your course material and to aid you on your path to success. SSC programs are facilitated by professional staff, graduate students, and trained undergraduate peer leaders who have previously excelled in their courses. Resources available to students include:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left:5em">
	  <li><p><strong>Peer Tutoring:</strong> make a one&ndash;on&ndash;one appointment with a Peer Tutor by going to <a href="http://www.sc.edu/success" class="uri">www.sc.edu/success</a>. If a course is not on the semester&rsquo;s supported&ndash;course list, there is a process for requesting assistance. The full schedule of days/times/locations for drop&ndash;in and Online Tutoring hours can also be viewed on the SSC website.</p></li>
	  <li><p><strong>Supplemental Instruction (SI):</strong> attend SI Sessions to focus on the most difficult content being covered in class. SI Leaders are assigned to specific sections of courses and hold three weekly study sessions that can serve as &ldquo;built&ndash;in study time.&rdquo; The schedule is posted on the SSC website each week and will also be communicated by the SI Leader.</p></li>
	  <li><p><strong>Peer Success Consultations:</strong> make a one&ndash;on&ndash;one Success Consultation with a Peer Consultant to work on developing study skills, setting goals, and connecting to a variety of campus resources. Your instructor may communicate with the SSC via Success Connect, an online referral system, regarding your progress in the course. If contacted by the SSC, please schedule a Success Consultation. Success Connect referrals are not punitive and any information shared by your professor is confidential and subject to FERPA regulations.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>SSC services are offered to all UofSC undergraduates at no additional cost. You are invited to call the Student Success Hotline at (803) 777&ndash;1000, visit <a href="http://www.sc.edu/success" class="uri">www.sc.edu/success</a>, or come to the SSC in the Thomas Cooper Library (Mezzanine Level) to check schedules and make appointments.</p>
