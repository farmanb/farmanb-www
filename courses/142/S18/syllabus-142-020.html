	  <h2 id="learning-outcomes" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Learning Outcomes:</h2>
	  <p>A student who successfully completes Calculus II (MATH 142) should continue to develop as an independent learner with the ability to approach problems from a conceptual viewpoint, to utilize more than one idea in a single problem, and to apply appropriate calculus skills to problems in context.</p>
	  <p>In particular, the successful student will master concepts and gain skills needed to solve problems related to techniques of integration, improper integrals, applications of integration, convergence of sequences and series, power series, Taylor and Maclaurin series, applications of Taylor polynomials, polar coordinates, area and length in polar coordinates.<br />
	  </p>
	  <h2 id="pre-requisites" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Pre-Requisites:</h2>
	  <p>Qualification through placement or a grade of C or better in MATH 141.<br />
	  </p>
	  <h2 id="text" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Text:</h2>
	  <p>The required text for this course is<br />
	  </p>
	  <p style="text-align:center">
	    <span>
	      <em>Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendentals
	      </em>
	    </span>,
	    13th Edition, Thomas, Weir, Hass, 2013.<br />
	    ISBN 9781323157138.
	  </p>
	  <p>The university bookstore offers two options for obtaining this text:</p>
	  <div class="inner">
	    <ul>
	      <li><p>A baundle that includes a hard copy of the text and a MyMathLab access key,</p></li>
	      <li><p>A MyMathLab access key that grants access to a digital copy of the text.</p></li>
	    </ul>
	  </div>
	  <p>You may choose either option, however, be aware that it is <span><strong>expected</strong></span> that you will read the text outside of lecture. In making your choice, be sure that you choose an option that you will read.</p>

	  <p>Homework assignments are available on MyMathLab. All MyMathLab homework assignments are currently available and may be accessed using the class key</p>
	  <p style="text-align:center"><span><strong>farman#####</strong></span></p>
	  <p>It is important that you create a MyMathLab account and register for the course as soon as possible.</p>
	  <p>The assignments are separated into three groups corresponding to the material on each of the exams. The problems are chosen to highlight the core concepts on each exam and mastery of these homework sets serve as a good indicator for exam performance. As such, you should ensure that you fully understand the material on these homework sets; that is, upon completion of the homework set, you should be capable of completing similar problems without the aid of the text or the various tools provided by MyMathLab.</p>
	  <p>The homework sets in each group are due the day before the corresponding exam. Late work will <span><strong>not</strong></span> be accepted, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that these assignments are completed on time. These assignments are relatively long, so you should be working through them as we cover the material. Do <span><strong>not</strong></span> leave these assignments until the last minute.</p>
	  <h2 id="exams" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Exams:</h2>
	  <p>There will be three in-class exams. The exams are tentatively scheduled as follows:</p>

	    Though unexpected, any deviations from this schedule will be announced during lecture and reflected on the course website.
	  </p>
	  <h3 id="missed-assessments" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Missed Assessments:</h3>
	  <p>There will <span><strong>not</strong></span> be any make-up exams or quizzes. If you miss one exam, your final exam grade will replace the missing exam grade. <strong>This policy is intended only for exams missed due to illness, accidents, etc. It does NOT mean that your lowest exam grade will be dropped.</strong> Any further missed exams will receive a grade of zero.</p>
	  <h2 id="final-exam" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Final Exam:</h2>
	  <p>There will be a cumulative final exam on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9:00 am. The date and time of the final exam is determined by the registrar and <strong>may not be changed</strong> except under extreme circumstances. <strong>Scheduling your travel home before the day of the final exam does not constitute a valid excuse for rescheduling the final exam.</strong> Failure to appear at the final exam will result in a zero on the final exam.</p>

	  <p>In partnership with UofSC faculty, the Student Success Center (SSC) offers a number of programs to assist you in better understanding your course material and to aid you on your path to success. SSC programs are facilitated by professional staff, graduate students, and trained undergraduate peer leaders who have previously excelled in their courses. Resources available to students include:</p>
	  <div class="inner">
	    <ul>
	      <li><p><strong>Peer Tutoring:</strong> make a one-on-one appointment with a Peer Tutor by going to <a href="http://www.sc.edu/success" class="uri">http://www.sc.edu/success</a>. If a course is not on the semester's supported-course list, there is a process for requesting assistance. The full schedule of days/times/locations for drop-in and Online Tutoring hours can also be viewed on the SSC website.</p></li>
	      <li><p><strong>Supplemental Instruction (SI):</strong> attend SI Sessions to focus on the most difficult content being covered in class. SI Leaders are assigned to specific sections of courses and hold three weekly study sessions that can serve as "built-in study time." The schedule is posted on the SSC website each week and will also be communicated by the SI Leader.</p></li>
	      <li><p><strong>Peer Success Consultations:</strong> make a one-on-one Success Consultation with a Peer Consultant to work on developing study skills, setting goals, and connecting to a variety of campus resources. Your instructor may communicate with the SSC via Success Connect, an online referral system, regarding your progress in the course. If contacted by the SSC, please schedule a Success Consultation. Success Connect referrals are not punitive and any information shared by your professor is confidential and subject to FERPA regulations.</p></li>
